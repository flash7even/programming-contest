# Programming Contest

**Algorithm Implementation**
This folder contains all the codes of all the algorithms I generally use in the programming contests. Most of them are my implementation. But there are also few codes which I added or modified from the template library of forthright48 and Zobayer vaiya.

**Code Repository**
This folder contains some well commented codes of some interesting problems I have solved. I learned something new solving most of these problems.

**Template**
This folder contains the base template I normally use during coding. Also it contains some c++ template like big integer/fast io etc which we need sometimes during solving problems.
